# 📐 Scientific Calculator (Python)

A modular **command-line scientific calculator** developed in Python.  
This project provides multiple mathematical utilities including geometry calculations, trigonometric functions, unit conversions, and basic arithmetic operations.  
The calculator is organized using a modular package structure to improve readability, scalability, and maintainability.
